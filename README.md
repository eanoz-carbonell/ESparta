# ESparta
ESparta is Ernesto's modified Sparta pipeline for RNAseq analysis in prokaryotes.

To use it, download Sparta (https://github.com/biobenkj/SPARTA_Mac) and substitute the files .py by the ones in this repository.

Main changes included are: mapping with bowtie2 and counting with featureCounts.
